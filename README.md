# Patching
To patch the ROM, obtain `flips.exe` and apply the bps patch over a vanilla DK64 US ROM<br />
<br />
# Build From Source
Follow this tutorial to get armips/gcc working first `https://hack64.net/Thread-Importing-C-Code-Into-SM64-Using-n64chain-and-armips`<br />
Once you can compile the example sm64 rom, create a new project directory and clone this repo<br />
Create a folder named `rom` and place a vanilla dk64 ntsc-u rom in there with the name `base-u.z64`<br />
Running `build.bat` will generate the modded rom with the name `DK64-U-Mod.z64` in the `rom/` directory<br />
